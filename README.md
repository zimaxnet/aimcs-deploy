## ÔøΩÔøΩ Changelog

### 2025-07-16 - Orb Game Transformation
- **Complete Redesign**: AIMCS now features an interactive 3D Orb Game as the main interface!
- **3D Interactive Experience**: Rotating orb with orbiting topic satellites powered by Three.js
- **Positive News Discovery**: Click satellites to hear uplifting current events via TTS
- **Real-time Scoring**: Track engagement with points, streaks, and achievements
- **Space-themed UI**: Beautiful gradient backgrounds with glass-morphism panels
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices

### 2024-07-16
- Added a new **Memory Trivia** mini-game accessible from the Control Panel. Compete with yourself by guessing answers from your past conversations!

### 2024-07-15
- Fixed a bug where the memory export endpoint (`/api/memory/export`) returned an empty array despite existing memories. The backend now correctly retrieves and exports all stored memories.
- If the Memory Panel does not show memories, verify the backend is running the latest code and that the `/api/memory/export` endpoint returns data. Use `curl https://api.aimcs.net/api/memory/export` to check.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (React + Three.js)
- **OrbGame Component**: Main 3D interface with Three.js and React Three Fiber
- **Interactive Satellites**: Clickable topic spheres with category colors
- **Real-time UI**: Live scoring, audio controls, and engagement tracking
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout for all screen sizes

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: TTS for topic audio generation
- **Topic Management**: Curated positive news content
- **Engagement Tracking**: User interaction analytics and scoring
- **Container Deployment**: Azure Container Apps with auto-scaling

### Data Storage
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database for topics and user engagement
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live scoring and leaderboard data
- **Topic Curation**: Positive news content with category classification

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Configuration

Before deploying the backend, you must set the `MONGO_URI` environment variable in your terminal. This is required for the backend to connect to your MongoDB Atlas database.

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:MONGO_URI="<YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING>"
```

**Bash/Zsh:**
```bash
export MONGO_URI="<YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING>"
```

Replace `<YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING>` with your actual connection string from the Atlas portal. The deployment scripts use this variable to configure the Azure Container App. If this variable is not set, the backend will fail to connect to the database.
